# Step 1
If you use Visual Studio Code and etc, Don't forget to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) ap (required +v16.9) on your computer then you will be able to enter this command in your console:
```
npm init -y
```
for create package.json file (If you use Replit you easily can skip this step)
# Step 2
Only need to Install [`discord.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) v14 library by enter this command in your console:
```
npm i discord.js
```
# Step 3
Make sure to fill out the `config.json` file by your information and according to the information that stated in their description
For example all of the `"url"` only accepts links that include `https` and `http` and **don't leave anything blank or omitted**
- Also you can change your bot's Activity Type with this [official docs](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/ActivityType) in the `index.js` file in line: [272](https://github.com/CalledMasih/Advanced-Welcomer-Bot/blob/main/index.js#L272) | Default is: `Watching`

# Step 4
If you are sure that all the information is filled and confirmed, run your file by enter this command in your console:
```
node index.js
```
so now that your advanced welcomer discord bot will go online and start it's exclusive working...
